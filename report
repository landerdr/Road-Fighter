Travis trouble getting right version of sfml
- solved with getting compiled package from site, extracting and copying to /usr/

Problem with travis' filepath to be different from pc
- looking into changing path to correct
- Wasn't related to file path in the slightest, I had changed the linux version to xenial instead of trusty, this apparently caused a conflict where the SFML was compiled with different settings
    fixed by changing back to trusty distro
